### Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

*He/Him, Developer [@plymouthsoftware](https://www.plymouthsoftware.com)*

I'm a part-time developer, part-time student (third year Computer Science at Plymouth Uni). I work primarily with Ruby on Rails, and have written a few articles on using Ruby on Rails with the reactive frontend framework Vue - check them out on my [website](https://www.delete44.com)...

Beyond this I'm a total music nerd & collect playing cards 😁♣️
