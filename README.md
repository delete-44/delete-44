## Hi, I'm Eddie

I'm a full-stack software engineer building beautiful & accessible experiences, currently tapping away [@Orbit](https://orbit.love/). The important stuff;

- My pronouns are he/him.
- I am a friend of Dorothy's. A fruit, a fairy, and a very, very queer man 🏳️‍🌈
- Talk to me about music, horror, drag, and crap films.
- Or, if you must, Ruby on Rails & React.
- You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/delete44.bsky.social) & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delete44/).

> "The queerness doesn't matter, so long as they're friends!"
