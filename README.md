## Hi, I'm Eddie

I'm a full-stack software engineer building beautiful & accessible experiences, currently tapping away [@Orbit](https://orbit.love/). The important stuff;

- My pronouns are he/him.
- I am a friend of Dorothy's & a very, very queer man 🏳️‍🌈
- Talk to me about music, horror, drag, and crap films.
- Or, if you must, Ruby on Rails & React.
- [Come find more of me!](https://www.delete44.com)
